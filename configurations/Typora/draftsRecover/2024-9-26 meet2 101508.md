## from previous meeting

1. who would use our model ? [grad students / radiologist / non medical]
   1. for multimodality : I said segmentation.. and you asked why ? [and i didnt have an answer]
2. Resarch gaps [besides using different kind of models]
3. Areas of improvement [efficieny or usage]

>1. radiologists and patients [for prescreening] and [report generation (human readable)]
>
>so when a radiologist suggests for a CT scan or mri they already kind of know which bone or segment they are going to be looking at ... since they already know the broad labels. [so they dont need it..]. But the patient might
>
>so after their scan the patient can get a copy of their scan and our model [while they wait in line for their doctor]
>
>and they can have time to educate themselves on these basic broad label. so they can ask better inferred quesions when they meet their doctor.
>
>possible questions they might wonder would be :
>
>* what am i looking at [semantic segmentation]
>
> * how does a healthy [xyz] label looks. [so we can try text to image (just to check quality) or even better would be if the clinic provides the healthy image of that xyz label instead of googling.]
> * what condition they might have ? [so we will also have to release a guarded VQA model (so that it doesnt say scary stuff)]
>
>
>And after the meeting [report generation]:
>
>* Scan image along side their segmentation . so that there is no confusion in what they are talking about.
>* summary of questions asked ..
