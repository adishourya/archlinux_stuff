# MEDPIX Visual Question Answering (VQA) Dataset

## Overview

This dataset builds on the **MEDPIX 2.0** dataset to create a Visual Question Answering (VQA) resource for medical imagery. It complements existing datasets like [VQA-RAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/flaviagiammarino/vqa-rad), which provides domain-expert validated QA pairs from a subset of MEDPIX. While VQA-RAD offers high-quality data, it may not have enough volume for many use cases. This dataset expands on the original captions, topics, and descriptions in MEDPIX by generating two types of question sets for each image (10 questions per image):

1. **Pre-training Questions**: These questions are derived directly from the MEDPIX description and case files. These are designed for use in early epochs for  getting good **next-token generation**.
   
2. **Alignment Questions**: These take in more context into account to develop more open ended and short QAs (generated using the **Llama 3.1 8B model**). These are intended for later epochs to improve model alignment.
