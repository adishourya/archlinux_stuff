I read an article from Korean Journal of Radiology which had some nice things to say.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10613849/

>To overcome these issues, some of the various possible solutions are as  follows: inclusion of training with longitudinal and multimodal  datasets, dense training with multitask and multimodal learning, new  generative models including anomaly detection, XAI,



I Mostly read on Collecting data and tokenization , since that will be our first steps.



For Data:

* Medpix2.0





For tokenization

*



Just so that its not complete replication of their work. I will make some changes by taking pieces of others architectures so that i could do ablation studies [Thats a research gap i think].
