# Quick Summary

I read an article from Korean Journal of Radiology which had some nice things to say.

>MTL allows a single AI model toperform multiple tasks simultaneously, thereby increasing its efficiency and adaptability. DLcan be used with multi-modality (different types of data) and longitudinal data (data collectedover time) to enhance AI's capacity to handle complex medical data. 

I Mostly read on Collecting data and tokenization , since that will be our first steps.



For Data:





For tokenization

Just so that its not complete replication of their work. I will make some changes by taking pieces of others architectures so that i could do ablation studies [Thats a research gap i think].
