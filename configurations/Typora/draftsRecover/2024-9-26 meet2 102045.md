## from previous meeting

1. who would use our model ? [grad students / radiologist / non medical]
   1. for multimodality : I said segmentation.. and you asked why ? [and i didnt have an answer]
2. Resarch gaps [besides using different kind of models]
3. Areas of improvement [efficieny or usage]

>1. [Radiologist and patients]
>
>   -------------
>
>   
>
>   Radiologists typically know which bone or anatomical region they will be examining before suggesting a CT scan or MRI
>
>   [so they dont need image segmentation]
>
>   
>
>   However, the patient might.
>
>   After the scan, the patient can receive a copy of their images while waiting to see their doctor. During this time, they can use our model to educate themselves on these basic, broad labels. This will help them prepare better, more informed questions for their doctor.
>
>   
>
>   Potential questions the patient might consider include:
>
>   - **What am I looking at?** [semantic segmentation]
>   - **How does a healthy [xyz] look?** We could explore using text-to-image technology for this, but an even better option would be for the clinic to provide a healthy example of the [xyz] label for comparison, instead of relying on online searches.
>   - **What condition might I have?** This is where a carefully regulated VQA (visual question answering) model could help, ensuring that the responses are appropriate and donâ€™t cause unnecessary alarm.
>
>   After their consultation, report generation could include:
>
>   - The scan image alongside its segmentation to ensure clarity in discussions.
>   - A summary of the questions the patient asked, providing them with a clear record of the conversation.
