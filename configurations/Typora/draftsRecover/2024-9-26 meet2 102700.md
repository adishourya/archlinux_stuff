## from previous meeting

1. who would use our model ? [grad students / radiologist / non medical]
   1. for multimodality : I said segmentation.. and you asked why ? [and i didnt have an answer]
2. Resarch gaps [besides using different kind of models]
3. Areas of improvement [efficieny or usage]

>1. [Radiologist and patients][hope its not generic.. this is still very informal]
>
>   -------------
>
>   
>
>   Radiologists typically know which bone or anatomical region they will be examining when they suggest the patient get a CT scan or an MRI
>
>   [so they dont need image segmentation]
>
>   
>
>   However, the patient might.
>
>   [better in clinics which have long latency]
>
>   * After the scan, the patient can receive a copy of the scan and our model while they wair to see their doctor.
>   * During this time, they can use our model to educate themselves on these basic, broad labels. This will help them prepare better, more informed questions for their doctor.
>
>   
>
>   Potential questions the patient might ask:
>
>   - **What am I looking at?** [would allow us to do : semantic segmentation]
>   - **How does a healthy [xyz] look?** [allows us to do: text to image but since they can look a bit cartoonish an even better option would be for the clinic to provide a healthy example of the [xyz] label for comparison, instead of them relying on googling image]
>   - **What condition might I have?** This is where a carefully regulated VQA (visual question answering) model could help, ensuring that the responses are appropriate and donâ€™t cause unnecessary alarm.
>
>   After their consultation, report generation could include:
>
>   - The scan image alongside its segmentation to ensure clarity in discussions.
>   - A summary of the questions the patient asked, providing them with a clear record of the conversation.
